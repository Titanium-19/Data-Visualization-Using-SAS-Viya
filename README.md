# Data-Visualization-Using-SAS-Viya
Using SAS Viya to explore business performance over various metrics

The Visaulizations were used to provide answers to the following questions:

Question 1 - What is the Product Sale for each country in South America? Use at least three types of charts and suggest which one in your
opinion works the best in answering this question.

Question 2 - How much was the product sale of “Kiosk” product line in Vancouver and in Toronto in 1998? Once again, use three
different charts of your choice to answer this question. Try to show the numeric values on the chart.

Question 3 - In which two months of 1998 the Product Cost of Sale was the lowest in Atlanta? What were the numerical values for those
two months (show the numerical values on the chart)?

 The pdf file contains the visualization and the inference derived from them.
